# Book Library
This project is a simple web application for managing a book library. It allows users to input the number of books and then add book details such as book name, price, author name, and author email. The application includes basic input validation to ensure data quality, displaying error messages for invalid entries.

Manual Testing Types:

During the testing phase of this project, I employed several types of manual testing to ensure its functionality, reliability, and user-friendliness:

    Functional Testing:
        I verified that all the functional requirements were met. This included testing the book count input, the form submission for adding books, and the display of error messages.  I checked if the "Add Book" button correctly captures and processes the entered data.

    Input Validation Testing:
        I rigorously tested the input fields (book name, price, author name, email) to ensure that the application correctly handles various input types and formats.  This involved entering valid and invalid data, including boundary values, special characters, and empty fields, to confirm that the validation mechanisms work as expected.

    Usability Testing:
        I evaluated the user interface and overall user experience.  This involved assessing the ease of navigation, clarity of instructions, and the intuitiveness of the form.  I looked for any potential pain points that a user might encounter while interacting with the application.

    Error Handling Testing:
        I specifically focused on testing the application's ability to handle errors gracefully.  This included verifying that appropriate and informative error messages are displayed for invalid inputs, and that the application does not crash or behave unexpectedly when errors occur.

    Boundary Value Testing:
         For numerical inputs like "number of books" and "price," I tested the boundaries (minimum, maximum, and values around the boundaries) to ensure the system handles edge cases correctly.

    Exploratory Testing:
        Beyond the scripted test cases, I also conducted exploratory testing to uncover unexpected issues. This involved freely exploring the application and testing different scenarios based on intuition and experience.
